write a program that uses std::cin to accept a nuber of words and store them in a vector

Continue reading strings until the user enters "quit".

One they enter quit, then print all the string they've entered except the strings that begin with 'b'.

Use apricot, banana, cherry, date and quit.

The above should not print banana and quit.
