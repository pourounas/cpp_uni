C++ is a compiled language, the compiler translates your code into an executable that
can be run by the cpu.

C++ is a statically typed language. This means the type of our objects is fixed at
compile time.

"Hello world" here is a string literal (a string in code)

Deterministic destruction (local variables destroyed when you leave scope)
This is probably the best feature of c++
